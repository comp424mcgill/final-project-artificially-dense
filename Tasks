1. Have minimax algorithm implemented with basic heuristic
1.1 Or mcst?
1.1.1 Good for large states spaces
1.1.1 Have some heuristics about what is more likely to be a better move to try out before randomly selecting an action
(i.e. have representative sample actions)
2. Think of other heuristics


Extra ideas:
1. Identify the opponent's strategy (most likely minimax, minimax with ab pruning, or mcst by testing for e.g. 3 rounds,
and use counter strategies
