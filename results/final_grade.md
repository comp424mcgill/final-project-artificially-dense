### Report Grade (40.0/50) 

#### TA Feedback 

The approach is very well motivated. However, the description of actual implementation could have been improved. Specifically it may help to break down various aspects of the working into separate sub-sections and link them to terminology used in Section 2.1. The writing style is sometimes more verbose than required, hindering readability. Pros should also focus more on scenarios where the agent performs better.
